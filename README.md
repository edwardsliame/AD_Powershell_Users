<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this tutorial weâ€™re going to walk through setting up an Active Directory home lab environment on a personal computer using Oracle VM VirtualBox. The PowerShell script in this repository will take the 1,000 usernames from the included text file and import them into Active Directory. Configuring and running this lab will help develop your understanding of how Active Directory and Windows Networking works. Please let me know if you have any questions!
